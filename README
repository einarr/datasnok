Datasnok - Small write-only matrix bot for file system events
=============================================================

Datasnok is a small python script that uses inotify to detect file system
events, and notifies a matrix room (see https://matrix.org/ ) about events on
specific files. Considered it a small, write-only matrix bot.

Dependencies
------------

 - python3
 - matrix client library, found at https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-python-sdk
 - pyinotify 

Configuration
-------------

Configuration is read from a json file at startup. See example-config.json for
an example.

Each watch is defined with a filename pattern, the event to watch for and the text
to write to the channel when the event occurs. Handled events are:
ACCESS, ATTRIB, CLOSE_NOWRITE, CLOSE_WRITE, CREATE, DELETE, MODIFY, OPEN

The text can use variables from the filename pattern, plus {path} for the full path
of the matched file.
